# The Four Color Theorem for maps in the real plane

This file states the Four Color Theorem as proved by Georges Gonthier in the Coq/Rocq
development `math-comp/fourcolor` (theorem `four_color` in `theories/proof/fourcolor.v`):

  **every simple map of the real plane can be colored with at most four colors, so that any
  two adjacent regions get different colors.**

The theorem covers *all* simple maps, including maps with infinitely many regions and
unbounded or irregular regions. Only the regions of the map must be open and connected.

## Provenance of the definitions

The definitions below transcribe, one for one and in the same order, the elementary
definitions of Gonthier's `theories/proof/realplane.v`. The Coq file is parametrized by an
abstract structure of real numbers (`Real.structure` in `reals/real.v`), and the theorem of
`fourcolor.v` assumes a model of the reals (`Real.model`); here they are specialised to Mathlib's
real numbers `ℝ`. All models of the reals are isomorphic (Coq file `realcategorical.v`), and
these definitions only use the order of the reals. Coq's `Real.lt x y` is notation for
`¬ Real.le y x`, written `x < y` here. Only basic logic, `ℕ` and `<` on `ℝ` are used. In
particular Mathlib's topology library is not used: open sets, closure and connectedness are
defined directly from open rectangles, exactly as in Coq. The same definitions are in the module
`FourColor.RealPlane` of the proof, which imports the same Mathlib file.

## Reading guide

* A `Region` is a set of points (`Point → Prop`). A `Map` is a relation on points
  (`Point → Region`).
* `PlainMap m`: `m` is a *partial equivalence relation* (symmetric and transitive, but not
  necessarily reflexive). Its equivalence classes are the regions ("countries") of the map:
  `m z` is the region containing `z`, and `cover m` (the points `z` with `m z z`) is the part
  of the plane covered by the map. Points outside `cover m`, such as the borders between
  countries, belong to no region.
* `Open r`: every point of `r` lies in an open axis-parallel rectangle included in `r`. This
  is the usual topology of `ℝ²`. `closure r` is the set of points all of whose open
  neighborhoods meet `r`.
* `Connected r`: two open sets that together cover `r` and both meet `r` must meet each
  other. For open `r`, this is the usual notion of connectedness.
* `SimpleMap m`: a plain map whose regions are open and connected.
* `border m z1 z2` is the intersection of the closures of the regions of `z1` and `z2`.
  `cornerMap m z` keeps the regions whose closure contains the point `z`. `notCorner m` is the
  set of points that lie in the closure of at most two regions of `m`.
* `Adjacent m z1 z2`: `z1` and `z2` lie in different regions of `m`, and the common border of
  these regions contains a point that is not a corner (a corner lies in the closure of three or
  more regions). For example, diagonally opposite squares of a checkerboard are not adjacent:
  their closures only share a point that is in the closure of four squares.
* `Coloring m k`: the coloring `k` is itself a plain map, whose regions are the color classes.
  It covers exactly the points covered by `m` (`coloring_cover` together with
  `coloring_consistent`). Each region of `m` lies inside a single color class
  (`coloring_consistent : Submap m k`). Points of adjacent regions get different colors
  (`coloring_adjacent`).
* `AtMostRegions n m`: all regions of `m` are among the regions of `f 0`, ..., `f (n - 1)`
  for some `f : ℕ → Point`. `ColorableWith n m`: `m` has a coloring with at most `n` colors.
